# BookBridge
Here I am created an "simple webpage for adding and deleting notes about books"  using  HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
I used external stylesheets and script files then linked into Html.<br/>
In html I used heading,paragraph,div tags and buttons and simple stuffs.<br/>
CSS I used simple stuffs like background color, container, margin,padding, font size,color, etc.. for Classes , Id.<br/>
In this I used Java Script to write some functions for adding, deleting books and some constraints to add books.
